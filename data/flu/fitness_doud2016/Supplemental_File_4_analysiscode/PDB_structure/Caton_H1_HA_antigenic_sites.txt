# This file lists the antigenic sites in the HA of H1 influenza (PR8). 
#
# It refers to the following reference:
# Caton et al, Cell, 31:417-427 (1982)
#
# In this paper, Caton et al define the antigenic sites of the HA, partitioning them
# into four categories (Ca, Cb, Sa, and Sb). Actually, they partition Ca into Ca1
# and Ca2, but here they are just grouped as CA.
# These data are in Table 3 of Caton et al.
# The following residues are in Table 3 but are not considered to be
# in the antigenic sites for the reasons explained by Caton et al.
#  * residue 273 (H3 numbering), see page 422 of Caton et al
#  * residue 182 (H3 numbering), see page 421 of Caton et al
#
# Note that the WSN HA has gained a glycosylation site at residue 142 (sequential numbering),
# which is 125 in H1 numbering and 129 in H3 numbering relative to the PR8 influenza HA that
# was studied by Caton et al. This additional glycosylation can differentially affect viral
# growth in different cell types, see:
# Deom et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 83:3771-3775 (1986)
# Because this analysis studies the WSN HA, it seems that this new glycosylation site should no
# longer be considered an antigenic site. Therefore, this position is excluded from being
# considered in an antigenic site even though it is classifed as being in Sa by Caton et al.
#
# Below, these antigenic sites are listed with the following columns:
# 1) WSN_NUMBER: number in sequential 1, 2, ... numbering of the A/WSN/33
#    sequence beginning with 1 at the N-terminal Met. 
# 2) WSN_RESIDUE: amino acid in WSN
# 3) ANTIGENIC_SITE: Ca, Cb, Sa, or Sb
# 4) H1_NUMBER: the H1 number used by Caton et al
# 5) H3_NUMBER: the H3 number used by Caton et al
# 6) PR8_RESIDUE: amino acid in the PR8 used by Caton et al
