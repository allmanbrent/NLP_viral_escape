# This file defines the receptor binding residues.
#
# It starts with the residues defined in Table 1 of Martin et al,
# Virology, 241:101-111 (1998). This table lists residues that contact
# receptor. However, not all of these residues are conserved. So an
# analysis is done to determine which if these residues are over 90%
# conserved in H1 HAs present in the Influenza Virus Resource as of
# April-9-2014.
# Residues that are not conserved at this level but are specified by
# Martin et al are commented out in the list below.
# 
# The columns are as follows:
# SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER : number in sequential 1, 2, ... numbering of the WSN 
#    HA.
# H3_NUMBER : number in H3 numbering scheme used by Martin et al.
# WSN_IDENTITY : identity in WSN HA.
# CONSENSUS_H1 : most common identity in H1 HAs.
# CONSERVATION : conservation in all H1 HAs of the consensus residue
#
# SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER H3_NUMBER WSN_IDENTITY CONSENSUS_H1 CONSERVATION
